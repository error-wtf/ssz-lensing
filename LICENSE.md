## About This Project

**SSZ-Lensing: Radial Scaling Gauge Validation Suite**

This software validates the theoretical framework presented in:

- **"Radial Scaling Gauge for Maxwell Fields"** - A geometric reparametrization with invariant local light speed

The code implements comprehensive tests for:
- Shapiro delay measurements (Cassini 2003, Viking 1979)
- Gravitational lensing (1919 Eclipse, Gaia 2021)
- Gravitational redshift (Pound-Rebka, GPS, Tokyo Skytree)
- Frame consistency and loop closure
